# wildlife-forensics
Repository for Wildlife Forensics course.

This repository contains the materials associated with teaching this course with a more student-centred focus: moving 
away from lectures and towards more discussions and activities. It also represents a shift towards a focus on the key 
aspects of Retrieval Practice:

1. Metacognition
2. Retrieval
3. Interleaving
4. Spacing
