	\subsection{Setting the Stage}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item If I were to talk to each of your professors from last term, and get a copy of the final exam for one of the courses that you took, and you were to take it again right now\ldots
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Raise your hand if you think you would do as well now as you did at the end of last term.
					\item Raise your hand if you think you would do just \emph{\textcolor{smured}{a little bit worse}} than you did at the end of last term.
					\item Raise your hand if you think you would do \emph{\textcolor{smured}{a lot worse}} than you did at the end of last term.
				\end{itemize}

			\item Why do you think that you would do worse?
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textcolor{blue}{Discussion}
				\end{itemize}

			\item But if the goal of the course was for you to learn that stuff, but you don't know it now, did you really learn it? (\emph{or perhaps they just memorized it for a little bit})
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textcolor{blue}{Discussion}
				\end{itemize}

			\item If how you did on the final exam does not represent what you really learned, what function does it serve (or any test)?
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textcolor{blue}{Discussion}
				\end{itemize}

			\item You are all experts at something (playing a sport, playing a musical instrument, drawing, painting, writing, playing video games, and so on)
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item How did you become an expert in that?
						\begin{itemize}
							\item \textcolor{blue}{Discussion}
						\end{itemize}

					\item Did you become an expert by \emph{\textcolor{smured}{listening to someone else talk about it}}?
						\begin{itemize}
							\item \textcolor{blue}{Discussion}
							\item No! You became an expert by \emph{\textcolor{smured}{practising yourself, over and over and over again.}}
						\end{itemize}
				\end{enumerate}
